Excited to share a recent data analysis project! ðŸš€ 
Responding to a request from the Sales Manager, we aimed to enhance our Internet sales reports by transitioning from static reports to dynamic visual dashboards.

Our primary goal was to provide a clear overview of sales, focusing on products, target customers, and trends over time. 
Leveraging Power BI and our CRM system, we cleaned and consolidated data from diverse sources, including a sales warehouse and a CSV file for the budgets.

User stories played a pivotal role in shaping the dashboard. 
These included detailed views for sales representatives by client and product, along with an overarching view for the Sales Manager, highlighting performance against budget.

The process involved creating queries to update, clean, and merge data, ensuring a robust database using SQL. 
Finally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was crafted, incorporating relevant charts and KPIs for in-depth sales analysis ðŸ’¡ðŸ“Š.
